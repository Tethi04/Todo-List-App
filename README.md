Overview:

To-Do-List-CLI-App is a console-based application built in Python that allows users to manage their daily tasks. It provides a simple, interactive menu to add, view, and remove tasks. All tasks are saved to a local tasks.txt file, so your to-do list persists even after you close the application.

Features
 * ✨ Cute Interface: A user-friendly, emoji-filled menu.
 
 * 📝 View Tasks: See all your current tasks in a clean, numbered list.
   
 * ✅ Add Tasks: Quickly add new items to your list.
   
 * ❌ Remove Tasks: Easily remove completed or unwanted tasks by their number.
   
 * 💾 Persistent Storage: Your tasks are automatically saved to tasks.txt and reloaded every time you start the app.
